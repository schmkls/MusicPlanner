# User stories
**A gym** uses MusicPlanner so that there is lower music during the day when older people usually visit for physiotherapy, and higher music in the evening.  

**A couple planning their wedding party** uses MusicPlanner. They want to play a specific playlist at low volume during the lunch, and then gradually play more party music at higher volume towards the night.  

*A hotel restaurant* uses MusicPlanner so that every morning music from a calm playlist at a low volume is planned, and then gradually higher and more funky music.
