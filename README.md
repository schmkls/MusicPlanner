# User stories
**A dentist** uses MusicPlanner in his waiting room so that during the hours when older people visit, the music has a lower tempo and is produced in the 70's or 80's. 
He chooses to filter his music by activating and drawing in the *tempo* and *decade*-graphs. 

**A host for a party** uses MusicPlanner in order to control the music for the party. She is playing a shared Spotify playlist with her friends. She activates the *tempo*-graph and *volume-graph* in order to have lower tempo and volume during the dinner, and higher tempo and volume l√∂ater in the night.
